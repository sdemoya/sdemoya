### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for stopping by! I'm currently building out a [portfolio](https://sdemoya.github.io/) to demonstrate a working knowledge of data analytics and cloud infrastructure/engineering. 

If you are interested in collaborating or have constructive criticism, I'd love to hear from you. Send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyedemoya/)! 
 
On a personal note, I'm passionate about sustainability, wildlife conservation and space exploration.
