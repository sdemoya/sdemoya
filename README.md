### Hi there 👋
Thanks for stopping by my github page. 

I'm currently building out a [portfolio](https://sdemoya.github.io/) to demonstrate working knowledge of data analytics and cloud infrastructure.

On a personal note, I'm passionate about sustainability, wildlife conservation and space exploration.
